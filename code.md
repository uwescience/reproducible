# Code

### Version control and archiving
 - [Git](git.html), the basis of [github](https://www.github.com)
 - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), note that [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
   allows repositories with either Git or Mercurial

### Code repositories

See [Repositories](repositories.html).

### Documentation and literate programming
 - [www.literateprogramming.com/](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
 - See also [Notebooks](notebooks.html)

## Package development as reproducible programming (emphasized by R programmers)
 - "Packages are the fundamental unit of reproducible R code" from [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) (2015) by Hadley Wickham (see also his book [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/))
 - ["Analyses as Packages"](https://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/analyses_as_packages.html) in R (2014) by Robert Flight
 - Specialized R Package Repositories (besides CRAN):
   - [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) for bioinformatics, available as an Amazon Machine Image or Docker Image.
   - [MRAN: Microsoft R Application Network](https://mran.microsoft.com/), a version of R designed for reproducibility, stability, and large-scale deployments.
