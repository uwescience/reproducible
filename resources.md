### Pitfalls of irreproducible research
 - add some examples
 - You don't want to end up in the
   [The Journal of Irreproducible Results](http://www.jir.com/)
   or, more seriously, here:
   [retractionwatch.com](http://retractionwatch.com/)
 - ["The Corruption of Peer Review Is Harming Scientific Credibility"](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hank-campbell-the-corruption-of-peer-review-is-harming-scientific-credibility-1405290747)
