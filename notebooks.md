# Notebooks
Overview of notebooks in scientific computing: [Interactive Notebooks: Sharing the code](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (2014) in Nature by Helen Shen.

### Jupyter Notebooks (formerly IPython)
Stands for Julia + Python + R (Ju + pyt + r)
 - [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/) home.
 - [Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
 - [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) shows a variety of sample notebooks.
 - List of [programming language kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages), notable additional languages include: Haskell, Ruby, Sage, Scala, Erlang, Perl, Octave, Matlab, Wolfram Mathematica, and Lua.
 - The [Markdown Language](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) works within any cell.
 - Here are a series of Caltech tutorials using Jupyter from the [Bi.1X Course: The Great Ideas of Biology](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/): setting up a [Jupyter Python environment](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/setting_up_python_enviornment.html), [basic bioinformatics](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/bioinformatics.html), using E.Coli images to learn [image processing](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/image_processing_1.html), and [nonlinear regression](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/nonlinear_regression_tutorial.html).
 - Here is a [Quantitative Economics](http://lectures.quantecon.org/index.html) course using Jupyer notebooks in either a [Python version](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html) or a [Julia Version](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/index.html).
 - Here are some notebook tutorials in [Julia for Optimization](http://www.juliaopt.org/notebooks/index.html).
 - Jupyter is about to release a next generation notebook, with a new user interface (UI) called  [JupyterLab](https://blog.jupyter.org/2016/07/14/jupyter-lab-alpha/).

### RStudio Notebooks
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for R.
 - The packages [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) create interactive notebooks and reports.
 - [R Markdown Notebook Documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).
 - A few other languages can be incorporated, notably Python and SQL using knitr.
 - Tutorials using R Markdown from the University of Georgia GEOL 8370 [Data Analysis in the Geosciences](http://strata.uga.edu/8370/) are found under "[R Tips](http://strata.uga.edu/8370/rtips/index.html)."

### Mathematica Notebooks
 - Interactive Mathematica Notebooks can be shared and viewed with the [Computable Document Format (CBF)](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf/adopting-cdf/) and CBF Viewer, very similar to the PDF and PDF Reader combination from Adobe.
 - A [free version of Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/) (for non-commercial use) is [available for use](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/mathematica-10/) on the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
 - [The Mathematica Journal](http://www.mathematica-journal.com/) is a scientific journal composed entirely of Mathematica notebooks (downloadable in PDF, CBF, and NB formats).
