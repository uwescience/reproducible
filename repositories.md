# Repositories for data and code

Add general discussion.

Many disciplines have public repositories where data to accompany
publications must be deposited, for example the
[Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do).
The [re3data.org project](http://www.re3data.org/) is a new directory of research data
repositories, here is an example of a record:
[The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection](http://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010208). It has a companion
website, [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/), with a data search engine and citation formatter.

General purpose repositories are also available that provide a Digital Object-Identifier (DOI) or other
permalink, for example:

 - [Github](https://www.github) is primarilly designed for code with Git version control;
   students can get free unlimited private repositories with [Github Student](https://education.github.com/pack),
   otherwise it is [$7/month for individuals](https://github.com/pricing).
 - [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories can use either Git or
   Mercurial; pricing is based on the size of a project's development team.
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
   includes [github integration](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/)
 - [Figshare](http://figshare.com/)
   includes [github integration](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/03/17/mozilla-science-lab-github-figshare-team-fix-citation-code-academia/)
 - [Research Compendia](http://researchcompendia.org/)
 - [RunMyCode](http://www.runmycode.org/)
 - Roll your own open data repository with [The Dataverse Project](http://dataverse.org/) or [CKAN](http://ckan.org/)
 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) has recently (August 2016) allowed anyone to publish data
   and a code "kernel" then execute that code on that data on Kaggle's platform (see ["Making Kaggle the Home of Open Data"](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/08/17/making-kaggle-the-home-of-open-data/) by Ben Hamner)
 - [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) includes integrataions with Github, Figshare, Dataverse, and AWS.
